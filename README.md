# Periodic
Potentially a mindustry mod.
The idea will be to create protons, neutrons, and electrons, which will be used in a synthesiser to create already existing elements and some new elements.

### How it will work
Players will reasearch a basic atom synth and will use low power and basic resources to extract a random, but small amount of atoms. This process should start around the time players unlock silicon. Players will then use the element constructor to make elements by selecting the amount of Pro, Neu, and Ele. This will require knowledge of the periodic table. Any element already in the game when made in the ele constructor will create the base game item. Any item not in the game will be added as a new item to create weapons, walls, ect. specific to this mod. The basic element constructor will only be able to produce items with so many protons so players aren't able to create high level items such as thorium so early. There will be tiers of the synth and constuctor.

### Elements already in the game
Copper, Lead, Beryllium, Tungsten, Titanium, Thorium, Silicon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen

### References
mainly for personal use. just stuff i have to reference to know how to function because im bad at coding.
